Python Project using Tkinter
Video is in project folder

1. Problem Statement
Problem Scenario:
The traditional way of booking the ticket for the movie is the customer needs to go
to the specific theatre where the desired movie was playing and need to stand in
queue and buy the ticket for the movie. This will become more difficult for a person
in order to overcome this problem.
The project gives real life understanding of online movie ticket booking systems
and activities performed by various roles in the supply chain. Here we provide
automation for movie ticket booking systems through the internet. Online movie
ticket booking system project captures activities performed by different roles in real
life ticket booking which provides enhanced techniques for maintaining the
required information up to date, which results in efficiency.
Proposed Solution:
The services offered by online movie ticket booking systems are (Made using GUI)
1.View the cities (using drop down options)
2. View the theatres in the cities (using drop down options)
3. View the list of movies present (using drop down options)
4. View the Screens and timing available (using drop down options)
5.Select the number of person.
6. Book the ticket, display the ticket information and save it in the local device.

2. Abstract

In the Movie Ticket Booking System, the program takes input from the customer like
name, number, City Name, Theatre Name which belongs to that city, and Movie
Name, Timing, No. of Tickets of their choice.
Then we verify all the details entered by the customer. For instance, the phone number
entered must consist of numeric values.
Once all the details are verified and deemed legitimate. The ticket is printed on the
right window. The customer is given the option to download the ticket to their local
system for future reference.
The program uses tkinter to develop the Graphical User Interface of the movie ticket
booking system. The GUI contains several windows like label, entry, message boxes,
buttons and frames.
Broadly, the program uses object-oriented concepts to create classes and
objects.Python’s built-in collections like lists and dictionaries have been used to store
city names,theatres, movie names and screen timings.
